### Graph Representation
- Model flights as a **directed graph**.
- Represent serviced cities as **vertices**.
- Use **directed edges** to connect departure cities to arrival cities.

### Network Flow Construction
- Assign **weights or flow capacities** to the edges, representing the number of crew members required per flight.
- Add a **source vertex**:
  - Connect this source to the base city of the airline where the personnel are located.
- Add a **sink vertex**:
  - Connect the sink to all destination cities.

### Optimization Objectives
- Calculate the **minimum flow** required to cover all vertices:
  - Determines the minimum number of crew members needed to operate all flights.
- Optionally, use **weighted vertices** based on city importance to:
  - Calculate schedules for a reduced number of crew members that might not cover all cities.
